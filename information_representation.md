# Information Storage
* The Smallest Addressable Unit: most computers use blocks of **8-bits** or **bytes**, as the smallest addressable unit of memory.

## Data Sizes

### Word Size
* Every computer uses word size to indicate the nominal size of pointer data. A virtual address is encoded by such a word.

### Virtual Address Space
* The most important system parameter determined by the word size is the maximum size of the virtual address space.

### Examples
* The C language allocate different number of bytes for different C data types. 
  * However the exact numbers of bytes for some data types depends on how the program is compiled for(32-bit or 64-bit).
    * Data type `char *` (a pointer) and `long` commonly have 4 bytes in 32-bit programs and 8 bytes in 64-bit programs.
    
### Implications

* Programmers should strive to make their programs portable across different machines and compilers. 
  * Make the program insensitive to the exact sizes of the different data types.
    * Ex1. Programs that enable communications over the Internet need to have data types compatible with the standard protocol.

# Integer Representations

## Integer Data Types

#### Integer Data Types in C
* Variable-Size Data Types
  * Each type can specify a size with keyword `char`, `short`, `int`, `long`, as well as an indication of whether the represented numbers are all nonegative (`unsigned`) or possibly negative (the default). 
  
* Fixed-Size Data Types
  * Their data sizes and range of values are fixed regardless of compiler and machine settings.
  * Example: `int32_t`, `int64_t`
  
## Unsigned Integer Encodings
* The range of values that can be represented as a `w-bit` vector: [0, 2<sup>w</sup>-1]
* Every number between `0` and 2<sup>w</sup>-1 has a unique encoding as a `w-bit` value

## Signed Integer Representation

### Two's-Complement Encodings
> It's defined by interpreting the most significant bit (i.e. x<sub>w-1</sub>, also called the 'sign bit') of the word to have negative weight.

* The range of values that can be represented as a `w-bit` twoâ€™s-complement number: [-2<sup>w-1</sup>, 2<sup>w-1</sup>-1]
  * The range is asymmetric: There's no positive counterpart of the minimum negative value.
  * The maximum unsigned value is just one over twice the maximum two's-complement value. 
* For nonnegative `x`, the `w-bit` representation of `-x` is: 2<sup>w</sup> - x. (???)
* Nearly all machines represent signed integers in two's-complement form.

### Alternative Representations of Signed Numbers
* Ones' Complement
* Sign Magnitude

### Implications
* The C standards do not require signed integers to be represented in two's-complement form, but nearly all machines do so.
* The Java standard requires a two's-complement representation with the exact same ranges as in 64-bit case.
  * In Java the single-byte type is called `byte` instead of `char`.
